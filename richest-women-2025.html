<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The year 2025 was a period of major upheavals and profound transformations worldwide. Geopolitical tensions, particularly between major powers like the United States and China, created uncertainty and weakened some supply chains. At the same time, energy prices soared, impacting heavy industry, transportation, and citizens’ daily lives. This instability highlighted the need to rethink our infrastructure and production methods.</p>

<p>But 2025 was not just a year of challenges. Technological innovations, especially in artificial intelligence and renewable energy, opened new opportunities. Many companies saw spectacular growth potential, whether through AI-focused cloud services or green energy projects. Those who adapted quickly, invested wisely, and leveraged new technologies were able to seize the advantage.</p>

<p>Despite these turbulences, some entrepreneurs and investors managed to grow and consolidate their fortunes. Figures like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault leveraged new economic trends to strengthen their empires. But 2025 was not an exclusively male-dominated year in terms of wealth. Women also stood out through their achievements and ability to generate colossal fortunes, proving that leadership and innovation know no gender. Their success and opportunities were shared equally with men: many women contributed decisively to these successes and transformations.</p>
