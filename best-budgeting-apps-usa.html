      <!-- Introduction -->
      <p>
        Personal budgeting apps aren’t just “nice to have” anymore—they’re practically essential. In 2025, a wide range of apps caters to everyone from absolute beginners to seasoned finance fans. Whether you prefer hands-on envelope budgeting or a fully automated, AI-powered assistant, there’s something out there for you. Gone are the days of Mint (it shut down in early 2024), so former Mint fans are branching out to find replacements. Modern tools automatically sync with your bank, categorize your spending, set goals, and even offer investment tracking. Best of all, they use bank-level encryption and two-factor authentication to keep your data safe.
      </p>

      <h2>YNAB (You Need a Budget) – Best Overall</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re serious about controlling every dollar, YNAB is hard to beat. Their zero-based budgeting approach means you assign every dollar a job—whether it’s groceries, rent, or savings. You actually sit down (virtually) and allocate your income each month. Yes, it takes commitment, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll see exactly where your money goes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, Web/Desktop, Apple Watch</li>
        <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> Zero-based budgeting method, automatic bank sync, goal-tracking, financial reports, and free workshops</li>
        <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> \$14.99/month or \$109/year (includes a 34-day free trial). Up to 6 users per account at no extra cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Bank-level encryption, two-factor authentication</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Total control over every dollar, excellent educational resources, high customer satisfaction (4.8/5)</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>PocketGuard – Simplest Free/Low-Cost Option</h2>
      <p>
        PocketGuard is perfect if you want a quick overview and don’t want to fuss with categories. Link your checking, savings, and credit accounts, and it automatically categorizes transactions. Its signature feature, “In My Pocket,” shows you exactly how much you have left after setting aside bills and savings. You can also add hashtags to transactions and negotiate bills right through the app.
      </p>
      <ul>

      <p>
        Inspired by the old-school envelope system, Goodbudget lets you manually allocate money into digital “envelopes” for groceries, rent, fun, and more. Because you enter income and expenses by hand, you stay fully engaged with your budget.

        Every app balances price, ease of use, and features differently. Free offerings (PocketGuard, Honeydue, Empower) cover the basics admirably, while paid subscriptions (YNAB, Monarch, Copilot) provide deeper control and advanced insights. All these platforms use secure connections and support iOS/Android (except Copilot, which is Apple-only). Ultimately, choose based on whether you prioritize simplicity, collaboration, or granular analytics. Happy budgeting in 2025!
